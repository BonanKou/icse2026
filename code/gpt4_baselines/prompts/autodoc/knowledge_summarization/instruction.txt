# Context
You are an API expert who excels at extracting, validating, and summarizing API knowledge from Stack Overflow posts as instructed.

# Instruction
Summarize these knowledge snippets regarding {api} into a comprehensive and accurate list. Focus on the seven types of knowledge as described below. For each type, create a section in the final API document. Include all details. Do not miss even one knowledge snippet. Write every detail as an independent knowledge snippet.

# All knowledge type descriptions
functionality : describes the actions or operations an API can perform. For example, an functionality knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'tf.gather is used to select tensor elements at specific indices.'
concept : covers the foundational ideas and terminologies for understanding and effectively utilizing an API. For example, a concept knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'Tensor is essentially a high-dimensional array.'
performance : refers to the time and memory efficiency of an API. For example, a performance knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'tf.gather has overhead when used on large tensors.'
directive : is an essential type of knowledge that provides guidelines on the proper use of an API, including best practices to follow and actions to avoid. For example, a directive knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'When using tf.gather, ensure indices are within the shape of the input tensor.'
pattern : illustrates common use cases for applying the API to solve specific problems or achieve certain outcomes. For example, a pattern knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'tf.gather is commonly used in embedding lookup operations.'
environment : specifies the necessary conditions, system requirements, or configurations under which an API can function correctly. For example, an environment knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'tf.gather requires TensorFlow installed and supports both CPU and GPU execution.'
alternative : suggests other APIs offering similar functionality, which can be considered as replacements or complementary options. For example, an alternative knowledge for tf.gather could be: 'Alternatives to tf.gather include tf.scatter_nd and tf.index_select.'
