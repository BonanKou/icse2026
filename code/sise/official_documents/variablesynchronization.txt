tf.VariableSynchronization

View source on GitHub
Indicates when a distributed variable will be synced.

View aliases
AUTO: Indicates that the synchronization will be determined by the current DistributionStrategy (eg. With MirroredStrategy this would be ON_WRITE).
NONE: Indicates that there will only be one copy of the variable, so there is no need to sync.
ON_WRITE: Indicates that the variable will be updated across devices every time it is written.
ON_READ: Indicates that the variable will be aggregated across devices when it is read (eg. when checkpointing or when evaluating an op that uses the variable).

Example:

>>> temp_grad=[tf.Variable([0.], trainable=False,
...                      synchronization=tf.VariableSynchronization.ON_READ,
...                      aggregation=tf.VariableAggregation.MEAN
...                      )]
Class Variables
AUTO	<VariableSynchronization.AUTO: 0>
NONE	<VariableSynchronization.NONE: 1>
ON_READ	<VariableSynchronization.ON_READ: 3>
ON_WRITE	<VariableSynchronization.ON_WRITE: 2>
