- `tf.TensorSpec` is used to describe the properties of a tensor, including its `shape` and `dtype`.
- `tf.TensorSpec` has both a `shape` argument and a `dtype` argument.
- A `tf.TensorSpec` with `shape=[2]` and `dtype=tf.int64` describes a tensor with two values of data type `tf.int64`.. Knowledge type: concept
