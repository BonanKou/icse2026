# SAXParser API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
1. SAXParser allows for counting nested start and end tags during XML parsing.
2. You can abort the parsing process when the final end tag is notified using SAXParser.
3. SAXParser is used to parse XML documents in a way that allows holding in memory only a small portion of the XML at a time, rather than the whole document.

## Concept
1. SAX (Simple API for XML) is an event-driven online algorithm for parsing XML documents.
2. SAX provides a mechanism for reading data from an XML document that is an alternative to that provided by the Document Object Model (DOM).
3. SAX parsers operate on each piece of the XML document sequentially, issuing parsing events while making a single pass through the input stream.
4. Using a SAX parser instead of a DOM parser allows you to hold in memory just a small portion of the original XML, which is useful for handling large XML files.

## Performance
1. If the problem is to hold in memory the whole file, simply don't do that. Use a SAX parser instead of a DOM parser so you can hold in memory just a little portion of the original XML.
2. SAXParser is "better" than DOM/XPath regarding memory usage.

## Directive
1. If you use a SAX parser, you can count nested start and end tags, and abort the parse when the final end tag is notified. Implement your application as a SAX filter to pass everything to the JAXB process and suppress errors from unwanted content following the XML.
2. When handling large XML files, use a SAX parser instead of a DOM parser to avoid holding the entire file in memory, allowing you to process only a small portion of the XML at a time.
3. To insert a custom ContentHandler, use SAXParser.getXMLReader().setContentHandler().

## Pattern
1. Using a SAX parser, you can count nested start and end tags and abort the parse when the final end tag is notified. Implementing your application as a SAX filter allows it to handle nested XML within larger texts by passing the parsed content to processes like JAXB, while suppressing errors from unwanted content following the XML.
2. Using a SAXParser is commonly recommended when you need to process large XML files without loading the entire document into memory, allowing you to handle only a small portion of the XML at a time.
3. The use of SAXParser involves setting a custom ContentHandler for parsing XML documents. When using SAXParser, it is important to note that:
   - `SAXParser.parse()` only accepts a `DefaultHandler`. If you need to use a custom `ContentHandler`, you must retrieve the `XMLReader` from the `SAXParser` and set the desired `ContentHandler` using `SAXParser.getXMLReader().setContentHandler()`.
   - SAXParser is used in combination with `ValidatorHandler` from a `Schema` to handle XML validation and content handling. The `ValidatorHandler` can be set as the content handler for the `XMLReader`.

(No specific knowledge provided for this category)

## Alternative
1. Alternatives to SAXParser include XPath, which is simpler to use if the XML document fits in RAM, and StAX, which combines the performance of streaming-based parsing with the usability of pull parsing.
2. Alternatives to SAXParser include DOM4J, JDOM, and StAX.
