# MBeanServer API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- MBeanServer can run a query with the ObjectName.

## Concept
- Get a reference to the MBeanServer then you can run a query with the ObjectName.
- MBeanServer is used in conjunction with JMX to manage and monitor resources such as applications and services in a Java environment.
- MBeans (Managed Beans) are Java objects that implement a specific interface to be managed by the MBeanServer.
- The JMX interface allows for operations like retrieving the size of HttpSession through MBeans.
- In the given code example, MBean `SessionMonitor` is used to interact with the session manager and retrieve session information using JMX.
- The MBean `SessionMonitor` manages access to the `ManagerBase` object through a static field.
- The `setSessionManager` method in the `SessionMonitor` class is used to initialize the static `sessionManager` field with a `Manager` object.
- The `getMemoryConsumption` method in the `SessionMonitor` MBean calculates the memory usage of active HTTP sessions.
- The `getNumberOfActiveHttpSession` method returns the number of active HTTP sessions.
- ByteMan is a tool utilized to access and manipulate classes at runtime in order to facilitate the integration with JMX when direct access to some classes (like `ManagerBase`) is restricted.

## Pattern
- Get a reference to the MBeanServer, then you can run a query with the ObjectName.
- The post illustrates a use case for using MBeanServer to monitor the size and number of active HTTP sessions by integrating with JMX. This is achieved by:
  1. Using ByteMan to modify the `ManagerBase` object and store it in a static field of an MBean, specifically `SessionMonitor`.
  2. Implementing a JMX interface (`SessionMonitorMBean`) to expose methods such as `getMemoryConsumption()` and `getNumberOfActiveHttpSession()`.

## Environment
- To access WebLogic's MBeans, add the JVM property: `-Djavax.management.builder.initial=weblogic.management.jmx.mbeanserver.WLSMBeanServerBuilder`.

## Alternative
