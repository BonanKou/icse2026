# uintArrayOf API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- `uintArrayOf` in Kotlin is used to create an `UIntArray`, which is an array of unsigned integers.
- The function supports the initialization of `UIntArray` with specified values.
- `UIntArray` elements can be accessed using standard array index notation, e.g., `array[index]`.
- You can iterate over `UIntArray` elements using a simple `for` loop or higher-order functions like `forEach`.
- `UIntArray` provides a `.size` property to determine the number of elements it contains.
- `UIntArray` supports common array operations such as `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and more.

## Concept
- `UIntArray` in Kotlin is an array of unsigned 32-bit integers, represented as `UInt`.
- The `UInt` type represents unsigned 32-bit integers that range from 0 to 2^32 - 1.
- `UIntArray` is a specialized array representation that avoids the overhead of objects for each element, similar to how `int[]` works in Java for primitive types.
- When targeting the JVM, `UIntArray` and similar unsigned types are implemented with type aliases and methods to manage unsigned behavior.
- Creating a `UIntArray` can be done using `UIntArray(size)` for an array of a specified size, or `uintArrayOf(vararg elements)` for an array initialized with specific values.
- Direct arithmetic operations on `UIntArray` elements might require explicit handling due to unsigned nature, especially when interfacing with other numeric types.

## Performance
- `UIntArray` is designed to be memory efficient, similar to primitive arrays, and provides better performance for arithmetic operations compared to using boxed `UInt` objects.
- Operations on `UIntArray` are typically fast due to the contiguous nature of the underlying storage, which is beneficial for cache performance.
- Consider performance implications when converting between `UIntArray` and other data structures, as this might introduce unnecessary overhead.

## Directive
- When using `UIntArray`, ensure that operations account for the unsigned nature of its elements, particularly in arithmetic or bitwise computations.
- Use `uintArrayOf` for initialization with known values and `UIntArray(size)` for creating arrays of a specified size with default values.
- Be cautious when interfacing `UIntArray` with other number types, as implicit conversions might not handle unsigned semantics correctly.
- If performing arithmetic operations that could exceed the `UInt` range, ensure proper handling to avoid unexpected results.
- Utilize Kotlin's standard library functions designed for unsigned operations to maintain consistency and correctness.

## Pattern
- Use `uintArrayOf` to conveniently initialize arrays with specific unsigned integer values.
- Iterate over `UIntArray` using `forEach` for concise and idiomatic Kotlin code.
- Combine `map` and `filter` for transforming and selecting elements from a `UIntArray` in a functional style.
- Use `reduce` to accumulate values from a `UIntArray`, such as calculating sums or products, while respecting unsigned arithmetic.
- Convert a `UIntArray` to a `List<UInt>` when interfacing with APIs that expect collections.
- Apply `sortedArray` to obtain a sorted copy of a `UIntArray`, while keeping the original array unmodified.

## Environment
- To use `uintArrayOf` and other unsigned types in Kotlin, ensure that your Kotlin environment is updated to at least version 1.3, where unsigned types were first introduced.
- Ensure your project configuration supports Kotlin's unsigned types, particularly if targeting platforms other than the JVM, such as Kotlin/Native.
- When working in mixed-language projects, especially with Java, understand how Kotlin's unsigned types interoperate with Java's signed primitives, potentially requiring explicit conversions.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to `UIntArray` for handling unsigned integers include using `IntArray` with manual handling to ensure values are within the unsigned range.
- Utilize `List<UInt>` if dynamic resizing or additional collection functionalities are required beyond what `UIntArray` provides.
- Consider using `BigInteger` for arbitrary-precision arithmetic when the range of `UInt` is insufficient for the application's requirements.
