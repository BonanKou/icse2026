# Synchronized API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- The `synchronized` keyword in Kotlin is used to create a block of code that can be accessed by only one thread at a time, ensuring thread safety.
- `synchronized` allows you to define critical sections of code where shared resources are accessed.
- It is used primarily to prevent race conditions in multi-threaded environments by locking a monitor object.
- The `synchronized` function takes an object as a parameter, which acts as the lock.
- When a thread enters a synchronized block, it acquires the lock associated with the specified object and releases it upon exiting the block.

## Concept
- In Kotlin, `synchronized` is a function that mimics the behavior of Java's `synchronized` block, providing an easy way to achieve mutual exclusion.
- The synchronization object (or monitor) is an instance of any class; common practice involves using `this` or a dedicated lock object.
- Synchronization is necessary when multiple threads are accessing and modifying shared mutable data.
- Deadlock risk occurs if two threads attempt to acquire the same locks in different orders. Proper lock ordering is essential to avoid deadlocks.
- While `synchronized` in Kotlin simplifies locking, it's critical to understand that it can lead to contention, slowing down performance if overused.
- A synchronized block guarantees visibility of changes to variables made by one thread to others after the lock is released.
- Unlike in Java, Kotlin does not have a `synchronized` keyword but offers a `synchronized()` function, leveraging Java interoperability.
- Synchronization works by associating each object with a lock, which can be held by only one thread at a time.

## Performance
- Using `synchronized` can introduce performance overhead due to context switching and contention when threads compete for the same lock.
- Excessive use of synchronization may lead to reduced concurrency and can become a bottleneck if not managed properly.
- Fine-grained locking (using different locks for different resource sets) can improve performance compared to coarse-grained locking (using a single lock for all resources).
- The performance impact of `synchronized` is generally lower for smaller blocks of code, keeping critical sections short is a best-practice.
  
## Directive
- Use `synchronized` judiciously to protect only those critical sections of code that require mutual exclusion.
- Always lock on a private final object to prevent external classes from acquiring your lock and causing a deadlock.
- Do not lock on objects that can be accessed outside the class, such as publicly accessible fields or objects returned from the class.
- Be cautious of deadlocks: avoid acquiring multiple locks at once, and ensure consistent lock acquisition order.
- Avoid long-running operations inside synchronized blocks to minimize lock contention and improve performance.
  
## Pattern
- A common pattern involves using `synchronized` to guard access to lazy-initialized variables, ensuring thread-safe access in a multi-threaded environment.
  ```kotlin
  private var resource: Resource? = null
  
  fun getResource(): Resource {
      return synchronized(this) {
          if (resource == null) {
              resource = Resource() // Lazy initialization
          }
          resource!!
      }
  }
  ```
- Use `synchronized` to protect increment and decrement operations on shared counters.
  ```kotlin
  private var counter = 0
  
  fun incrementCounter() {
      synchronized(this) {
          counter++
      }
  }
  ```
- Protect collections access using synchronized blocks to prevent concurrent modification exceptions.
  ```kotlin
  val list = mutableListOf<Int>()
  
  fun addToList(item: Int) {
      synchronized(list) {
          list.add(item)
      }
  }
  ```

## Environment
- `synchronized` relies on JVM's intrinsic locks, making it specific to Kotlin/JVM and not available in Kotlin/Native or Kotlin/JS.
- Ensure that the underlying JVM supports multi-threading features required for proper function of `synchronized`.
- Running under a JVM version 1.6 or newer typically ensures compatibility with `synchronized` due to its reliance on Java's concurrency primitives.

## Alternative
- Consider using `ReentrantLock` from the `java.util.concurrent.locks` package for advanced locking mechanisms that provide more flexibility than `synchronized`.
- Atomic classes like `AtomicInteger`, `AtomicBoolean`, etc., are alternatives to `synchronized` for scenarios involving simple atomic operations.
- The `ConcurrentHashMap` and other collections from the `java.util.concurrent` package can be used to manage collections without explicit synchronization.
- The `coroutines` library provides a high-level concurrency model in Kotlin, which can be an alternative to using `synchronized` for managing concurrent tasks.
