### Comprehensive API Document for `TreeMap` in Java Library

#### 1. Functionality

1. **Purpose of `TreeMap`**:  
   `TreeMap` is a map implementation that automatically sorts entries based on their keys. It implements the `SortedMap` and `NavigableMap` interfaces, enabling sophisticated map operations.

2. **Primary Operations**:  
   Common operations in `TreeMap` include `put(K key, V value)`, `get(Object key)`, and `remove(Object key)`, used for inserting, retrieving, and removing entries, respectively.

3. **Contains Methods**:  
   `TreeMap` provides methods like `containsKey(Object key)` and `containsValue(Object value)` to check for the presence of specific keys or values.

4. **Navigable Operations**:  
   Supports navigable operations such as `firstKey()`, `lastKey()`, `floorKey(K key)`, and `ceilingKey(K key)`, which help retrieve keys based on their ordering in the map.

5. **Code Example - Basic Operations**:
   ```java
   TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
   map.put(1, "Apple");
   map.put(3, "Banana");
   map.put(2, "Cherry");
   String fruit = map.get(2);  // returns "Cherry"
   map.remove(1);              // removes entry with key 1
   ```

#### 2. Concept

6. **Java Collections Framework**:  
   `TreeMap` is part of the Java Collections Framework, offering a sorted map implementation using a tree data structure.

7. **Red-Black Tree**:  
   Internally, `TreeMap` uses a Red-Black Tree, which is a self-balancing binary search tree, ensuring sorted order of keys.

8. **Natural Ordering and Comparator**:  
   By default, `TreeMap` uses natural ordering of keys. Users can provide a custom comparator to define a specific order.

9. **Interfaces Implemented**:  
   Implements `NavigableMap`, providing navigation methods, and `SortedMap`, providing a map view sorted by natural ordering or a comparator.

10. **Comparison with `HashMap` and `LinkedHashMap`**:  
    `TreeMap` provides sorted order; `HashMap` offers constant-time performance, and `LinkedHashMap` preserves insertion order.

#### 3. Performance

11. **Time Complexity**:  
    Operations like `get`, `put`, `remove` have logarithmic time complexity, i.e., O(log n), due to the Red-Black Tree structure.

12. **Comparison with `HashMap`**:  
    `HashMap` offers O(1) time complexity for basic operations, whereas `TreeMap` has O(log n) due to sorting overhead.

13. **Memory Considerations**:  
    Additional memory is used in `TreeMap` to maintain the tree structure, compared to `HashMap`.

#### 4. Directive

14. **When to Use `TreeMap`**:  
    Choose `TreeMap` if the order of keys is important, especially for range-type queries or when natural sorting of elements is needed.

15. **Mutability of Keys**:  
    Avoid using mutable objects as keys in `TreeMap` to prevent unpredictable behavior and maintain consistency in sorting.

16. **Recommendation for Keys**:  
    Use immutable data types for keys to ensure the effectiveness of sorting and reduced risk of errors.

17. **Initial Capacity and Load Factor**:  
    Unlike `HashMap`, `TreeMap` doesn't have capacity-related parameters; focus on comparator or natural ordering.

#### 5. Pattern

18. **Natural Ordering**:  
    Suitable for tasks requiring natural ordering, such as creating leaderboards or sorted collections of objects.

19. **Range Views**:  
    Utilize subMap, headMap, and tailMap methods to view a portion of the map based on key ranges.

20. **Priority Queue Usage**:  
    `TreeMap` can be utilized for priority queue-like operations where key priority is determined by sorting order.

21. **Code Example - Range View**:
    ```java
    TreeMap<Integer, String> map = new TreeMap<>();
    map.put(1, "One");
    map.put(2, "Two");
    map.put(3, "Three");
    SortedMap<Integer, String> subMap = map.subMap(1, 3);
    System.out.println(subMap); // prints {1=One, 2=Two}
    ```

22. **Sample Code - Student Grades**:
    ```java
    TreeMap<String, Integer> grades = new TreeMap<>();
    grades.put("Alice", 85);
    grades.put("Bob", 95);
    grades.put("Charlie", 78);
    ```

#### 6. Environment

23. **JDK Compatibility**:  
    `TreeMap` is available since JDK 1.2, making it compatible with all subsequent Java versions.

24. **Operating Systems**:  
    `TreeMap` runs on any OS supporting the Java runtime environment, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

25. **Memory Allocation**:  
    Ensure appropriate Java heap size for large `TreeMap` instances to avoid memory-related issues.

#### 7. Alternative

26. **Comparison with `HashMap`**:  
    Choose `HashMap` for unordered collections requiring fast insertion and lookup; unsuitable if key order is needed.

27. **LinkedHashMap for Insertion Order**:  
    Use `LinkedHashMap` if the order of key insertion needs to be retained without sorting keys.

28. **ConcurrentSkipListMap**:  
    Offers concurrent access with ordering, similar to `TreeMap`, appropriate for multi-threading environments.

29. **Third-Party Libraries**:  
    Libraries like Apache Commons Collections may provide additional features such as BidiMap for bidirectional maps.

30. **Code Example - Comparator**:
    ```java
    TreeMap<String, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>(Comparator.reverseOrder());
    map.put("One", 1);
    map.put("Two", 2);
    map.put("Three", 3);
    ```

31. **Code Example - Using `LinkedHashMap`**:
    ```java
    LinkedHashMap<Integer, String> linkedMap = new LinkedHashMap<>();
    linkedMap.put(1, "One");
    linkedMap.put(2, "Two");
    ```

32. **When to Use ConcurrentSkipListMap**:  
    Opt for `ConcurrentSkipListMap` when requiring a thread-safe and naturally ordered map implementation.

33. **Alternative Use of `TreeSet`**:  
    If only unique, ordered keys are required without values, consider using `TreeSet`.

34. **Code Example - `TreeSet`**:
    ```java
    TreeSet<Integer> treeSet = new TreeSet<>();
    treeSet.add(3);
    treeSet.add(1);
    treeSet.add(2);
    ```

35. **Code Example - Mix `TreeMap` and `HashSet`**:
    ```java
    TreeMap<String, HashSet<String>> multiMap = new TreeMap<>();
    ```
