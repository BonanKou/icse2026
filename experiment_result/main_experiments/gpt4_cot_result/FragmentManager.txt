Here is a comprehensive API document for FragmentManager from the Android library, organized into the seven specified sections: Functionality, Concept, Performance, Directive, Pattern, Environment, and Alternative. Each section contains knowledge snippets relevant to the API.

### 1. Functionality
- **Snippet 1**: FragmentManager is responsible for managing fragments in an Android app, allowing developers to add, remove, replace, and attach/detach fragments dynamically.
  
- **Snippet 2**: You can add a fragment to an activity programmatically by using `FragmentManager.beginTransaction().add(containerId, fragment).commit()`.

- **Snippet 3**:
  ```java
  FragmentManager fragmentManager = getSupportFragmentManager();
  FragmentTransaction fragmentTransaction = fragmentManager.beginTransaction();
  SampleFragment sampleFragment = new SampleFragment();
  fragmentTransaction.add(R.id.fragment_container, sampleFragment);
  fragmentTransaction.commit();
  ```
  Adds a `SampleFragment` to a container view with the ID `fragment_container`.

- **Snippet 4**: Removing a fragment is done using `FragmentManager.beginTransaction().remove(fragment).commit()`, which detaches the fragment from the activity.

- **Snippet 5**: Use `FragmentManager.beginTransaction().replace(containerId, newFragment).commit()` to replace an existing fragment with a new one.

- **Snippet 6**:
  ```java
  fragmentTransaction.replace(R.id.fragment_container, new SampleFragment());
  fragmentTransaction.commit();
  ```
  Replaces the current fragment in the container with `SampleFragment`.

### 2. Concept
- **Snippet 7**: A Fragment in Android represents a portion of the user interface in a FragmentActivity and can be used to build dynamic and flexible UI designs.

- **Snippet 8**: Fragments have their own lifecycle methods, similar to Activities, such as `onCreate()`, `onCreateView()`, `onPause()`, and `onDestroyView()`.

- **Snippet 9**: FragmentManager operates within an Activity and is responsible for orchestrating fragment transactions and lifecycle events.

- **Snippet 10**: The fragment lifecycle is tied to the lifecycle of the hosting activity, meaning fragments are destroyed and recreated alongside activities.

### 3. Performance
- **Snippet 11**: Fragment transactions are executed asynchronously on the main thread, which can cause performance overhead if complex operations are performed during transactions.

- **Snippet 12**: Minimize the work done in `Fragment.onCreateView()` to improve UI rendering speed. Inflate views using a dedicated layout file.

- **Snippet 13**: Utilize `setRetainInstance(true)` for fragments to retain fragment objects across configuration changes, preventing creation of a new fragment instance.

### 4. Directive
- **Snippet 14**: Always check if a fragment is added before performing actions to avoid IllegalStateException. For example, `if (fragment.isAdded()) { /* Perform action */ }`.

- **Snippet 15**: When handling the back stack, use `addToBackStack(tag)` to add a FragmentTransaction to the back stack and `popBackStackImmediate()` to manage user navigation effectively.

- **Snippet 16**: Avoid directly modifying views in transaction methods, e.g., `add()` or `remove()`, as these changes should be made in `onCreateView()` or `onViewCreated()`.

- **Snippet 17**: Use `FragmentManager.executePendingTransactions()` judiciously to ensure immediate execution of transactions but be cautious as it may block the UI thread.

- **Snippet 18**: Always remove or detach unused fragments to avoid memory leaks and unnecessary resource consumption.

### 5. Pattern
- **Snippet 19**: For dynamic UI updates, use FragmentManager to switch between fragments based on user actions, providing smooth navigation and transition effects.

- **Snippet 20**: Handle configuration changes, such as screen orientation, by retaining fragments and using `FragmentTransaction.detach()` and `attach()` to preserve state.

- **Snippet 21**: Implement multi-pane layouts on tablets using FragmentManager to simultaneously show two or more fragments side by side.

### 6. Environment
- **Snippet 22**: Requires Android SDK version 11 (Honeycomb) or higher for core FragmentManager functionality.

- **Snippet 23**: For backward compatibility, use the AndroidX libraries (`androidx.fragment.app.FragmentManager`).

- **Snippet 24**: Ensure that the hosting activity extends `FragmentActivity` or its subclasses to use FragmentManager effectively.

### 7. Alternative
- **Snippet 25**: The Android Jetpack Navigation component can be an alternative to FragmentManager, providing a more structured approach for in-app navigation.

- **Snippet 26**: Consider using `ViewPager2` for managing a collection of fragments that a user can swipe between.

Now, let's provide additional snippets for some sections to enhance completeness.

### 1. Functionality (Continued)
- **Snippet 27**: Use `FragmentManager.findFragmentById(containerId)` to retrieve a fragment by its container view ID.

- **Snippet 28**: `FragmentManager` can listen to lifecycle events using a `FragmentLifecycleCallbacks` interface.

### 2. Concept (Continued)
- **Snippet 29**: The back stack in FragmentManager stores fragment transactions allowing users to navigate back through fragment states.

### 3. Performance (Continued)
- **Snippet 30**: Reducing fragment inflation times by instantiating fragments lazily when needed can improve initial activity load times.

### 4. Directive (Continued)
- **Snippet 31**: Ensure fragment transactions are handled after any `FragmentActivity` state changes, such as after `onSaveInstanceState()`.

### 5. Pattern (Continued)
- **Snippet 32**: Implement Master-Detail pattern using fragments for detailed view navigation, common in applications with item lists.

### 6. Environment (Continued)
- **Snippet 33**: The application manifest should specify permissions for features utilized within fragments, aligning with the host activity.

### 7. Alternative (Continued)
- **Snippet 34**: Use `DialogFragment` for managing dialogs associated with fragments to encapsulate dialog functionality and lifecycle.

By organizing and expanding these snippets, developers can gain a thorough understanding of FragmentManager usage within Android applications, enhancing their ability to utilize this powerful API effectively.
