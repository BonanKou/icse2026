If you want to create different variants of your manifest file, you'll have to do that from outside the Android app, before building the various apps.
if you want any kind of interaction with other apps you must add the package's name into the manifest file.
If you are using on Android 11 (Api level 30), you must have to include <queries> in your Manifest.xml file inside <manifest> tag.
When building your app, the Gradle build merges all manifest files into a single manifest file that's packaged into your app.
