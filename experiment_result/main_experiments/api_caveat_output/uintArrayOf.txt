So a very simple method that when called in kotlin like "fred".greeting will return hello fred.
If you check the kotlin byte code and decompile it in the IDE, you can see that the result is something similar to:

A static method in a class StringUtilsKt.
Let me know If not

}
If you *really keyOf() to be a top-level function in Kotlin, you can define functions for Kotlin-only and Java-only use separately.
First of all you should not mix Kotlin versions.
TLDR: If you need the sequential execution, because you have some state that changes see bottom.

If you want to use the Kotlin Random class then use like this.
Only the parameterless constructor is deprecated, it is now preferred that you specify the Looper in the constructor via the Looper.getMainLooper() method.
Maybe something like this:

If you're on the newer version where it should be fixed, make sure you definitely are only getting 1s - it's unlikely you'd randomly get 1 every time, but it's not impossible, especially with only two possible outcomes.
= null
    }
Obs:

The default value of the variables in kotlin is public
In this way the equivalent of public static $bitValueTable = null;
in kotlin is: 

companion object {
        var bitValueTable : Array<Type>?
Disclaimer: I do not need Kotlin syntax but AFAIK, Java code can be executed as it is in Kotlin or at least anyone working with Kotlin should be able to translate a Java code easily into Kotlin syntax.
Note: If you are working for an Android project and your Android API level is still not compliant with Java-8, check Java 8+ APIs available through desugaring and How to use ThreeTenABP in Android Project.
The date-time API of java.util and their formatting API, SimpleDateFormat are outdated and error-prone.
It is recommended to stop using them completely and switch to the modern date-time API.
Using the modern date-time API:

Output:

Note that LocalDate#toString already returns the string in the ISO-8601 format, which is the format you want the output string in, and therefore you do need a formatter to get the string into the required format.
It makes it clear if the Array is Mutable or not.
