TLDR: If you need the sequential execution, because you have some state that changes see bottom.
It makes it clear if the Array is Mutable or not.
Let me know If not

So a very simple method that when called in kotlin like "fred".greeting will return hello fred.
If you check the kotlin byte code and decompile it in the IDE, you can see that the result is something similar to:

A static method in a class StringUtilsKt.
So, you should have a separate method for other case.
To understand, you need to see how your kotlin code is converted into Java byte code.
Only the parameterless constructor is deprecated, it is now preferred that you specify the Looper in the constructor via the Looper.getMainLooper() method.

If you want to use the Kotlin Random class then use like this.
This example will run directly in Intellij or from the command line if you have kotlin installed.
From the example you've provided it's hard to tell if there is a logic problem in your code.
Binary     -> 1 Kilobyte = 1024 Byte
Non-Binary -> 1 Kilobyte = 1000 Byte

Native kotlin method below, if your API level is less than or equal to 24(Nougat), it uses binary format.
If greater, it uses non-binary format.
