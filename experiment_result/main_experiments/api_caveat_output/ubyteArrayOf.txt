So when getShort is called, the buffer read the first two bytes and return the corresponding short value.
If you want to read other parts of the ble information, you may want to wrap() the whole ByteArray and then read multiple parts of it with other methods of ByteBuffer.
From one of your line

[-6, 5, 0, 3, 0, 1, 108, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0] ========364gm


Here, buffer only contains bytes 5 and 6.
Yes you need to decode the base64 into a ByteArray then write the bytes to a location with the postfix .apk.
So you just have to do:
Binary     -> 1 Kilobyte = 1024 Byte
Non-Binary -> 1 Kilobyte = 1000 Byte

Native kotlin method below, if your API level is less than or equal to 24(Nougat), it uses binary format.
If greater, it uses non-binary format.
When your Fetcher function is called, it will be passed a particular Key value.
If available, it will be returned from the in memory cache or the persister
the key is to define your data, the object which you use as key have to override the hashCode method, define your own rule.
