## AdapterStateHelper API Documentation

### 1. Functionality

1. **State Management**: `AdapterStateHelper` facilitates the management of adapter states, allowing you to dynamically enable or disable adapters in a system.
2. **Persistence**: It provides mechanisms for persisting adapter states, ensuring that a system can restore its configuration after a restart.
3. **Synchronization**: The API supports concurrent state access and updates, offering thread-safe operations to manage adapters.
4. **Query**: You can query the active adapters and their current states using intuitive methods in the API.

### 2. Concept

1. **Adapter**: An adapter is a modular component that can be toggled on or off in a software system, typically representing a piece of functionality or a state.
2. **State**: In `AdapterStateHelper`, a state refers to the current status (e.g., enabled or disabled) of an adapter at any given time.
3. **Thread Safety**: Operations performed on adapter states are designed to be thread-safe, meaning they can be safely invoked by multiple threads simultaneously.
4. **Persistence Mechanism**: The API supports saving the state to a persistent storage such as a database or file, enabling recovery after application restarts.
5. **Atomic Operations**: `AdapterStateHelper` uses atomic operations to change states to prevent inconsistent states during concurrent state changes.

### 3. Performance

1. **Efficiency in State Switching**: State switching operations are optimized to execute quickly, minimizing overhead even under high-concurrency environments.
2. **Memory Usage**: The API is designed to use minimal memory overhead when maintaining the state information of multiple adapters.
3. **Concurrency Handling**: The API supports high levels of concurrency without significant degradation in performance, allowing multiple threads to operate efficiently.

### 4. Directive

1. **Ensure Correct Initialization**: Always initialize `AdapterStateHelper` correctly before performing state operations to avoid runtime exceptions.
2. **Use Concurrent Collections**: Utilize the built-in concurrent collections provided by `AdapterStateHelper` to maintain adapter states.
3. **Synchronize Persistence Calls**: When persisting state information, synchronize calls appropriately to ensure data consistency.
4. **Monitor Adapter Usage**: Regularly monitor which adapters are in use and clean up unused entries to maintain optimal performance.
5. **Error Handling**: Implement robust error handling to manage potential exceptions during state operations or persistence.

### 5. Pattern

1. **Dynamic Feature Toggles**: Use `AdapterStateHelper` to implement dynamic feature toggles that can be switched on or off at runtime.
2. **Configuration Management**: Manage different application configurations by switching between adapter states based on the environment or user preferences.
3. **A/B Testing**: Implement A/B testing scenarios by having different adapter configurations serve different user segments.
4. **Logging State Changes**: Maintain a log of adapter state changes to track historical modifications and debug issues.

   ```java
   AdapterStateHelper adapterHelper = new AdapterStateHelper();
   adapterHelper.enable("FeatureA");
   adapterHelper.disable("FeatureB");
   ```

5. **Load Balancing**: Use adapter states to manage load balancing by enabling or disabling servers or services.
6. **Modular System Design**: Architect systems where features are modularized as adapters, enabling flexible deployments.

### 6. Environment

1. **Java Platform**: `AdapterStateHelper` is designed to run on the Java platform and requires a compatible JRE.
2. **Concurrent Execution**: Optimally functions in environments that require concurrent execution, taking advantage of Java's concurrency utilities.
3. **Persistent Storage**: When using state persistence, ensure suitable DB or file storage is configured and accessible.

### 7. Alternative

1. **ConfigurationProperties**: Use `ConfigurationProperties` for dynamic configuration management if persistence is not needed.
2. **FeatureFlags Libraries**: Consider using other feature flag libraries like `FF4j` or `LaunchDarkly` for complex feature toggling scenarios.
3. **Spring Profiles**: For applications within a Spring framework, Spring Profiles can offer an alternative for managing different application states.
4. **Apache Zookeeper**: For distributed systems requiring strong consistency, consider using Zookeeper for managing distributed states.
5. **Consul**: Another alternative for managing application states in a distributed environment is Consul, especially when using microservices.
6. **Etcd**: Utilize Etcd for distributed key-value storage and service discovery, acting as a central store for adapter states.
7. **Env Variables**: For simple setups, environment variables can be an alternative for configuring stateful behaviors.
8. **Toggle libraries in Other Languages**: For applications not based in Java, libraries specific to that language might be more suitable.
9. **Spring Cloud Config**: For cloud-based applications, Spring Cloud Config can manage configuration across distributed systems efficiently.
