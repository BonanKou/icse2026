If you change your key, all existing data will get corrupted.
But in case the key gets compromised, you would be in a mess.
It can't be set from client-side application code, as that would be a security risk.
If you want to determine the UID of your users, you can implement your own provider.
If you had used the usual auto-incrementing IDs, you would have to re-index every blog post of the databases and update every foreign key that might point to them.
They look something like:
cc26d321-58fc-4cc1-978a-03f2bbdb2a55

Just add a column of type UUID in your document entity and use it as the unique identifier.
It will solve your problem as well because it will be difficult to guess the next uuid in comparison to the integer numbers.

The reason for the criticism is that usually the id is the primary key and it's a sequential number.
