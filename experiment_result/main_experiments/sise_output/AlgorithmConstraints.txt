In your code example, the input size is constant 3x3, so if this never changes, then you can just say the algorithm has constant time complexity, O(1).
If the input can change, then it is up to you to decide how it can change, and how it makes sense to define it.
In this case, it is clear that the running time depends only on the size of the input, not on its content.
It is also perfectly correct to define n as the total number of elements in your array.
In your case, your input size n = high - low which is exactly the number of iterations your algorithm is executing.
So it is up to you to define a variable that describes your input size.
