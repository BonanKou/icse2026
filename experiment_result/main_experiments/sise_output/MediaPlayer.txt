            val playbackState = mediaController.playbackState
            if (playbackState?.state == PlaybackState.STATE_PLAYING || 
                playbackState?.state == PlaybackState.STATE_BUFFERING) {
                val mediaMetadata = mediaController.metadata
                // Use the metadata to get information about the currently playing song
                //
            }
        }
    }


On Android, you can use the MediaPlayer class to play sound.
To determine which MediaController is currently playing when there are multiple active sessions, you can use the MediaController.getPlaybackState() method to get the current playback state of each MediaController.
mSessionsChangedListener =
    MediaSessionManager.OnActiveSessionsChangedListener { list: List&lt;MediaController&gt;?
Try debugging your application by switching to other Media applications (then connect BT) and then check whether the System starts your service or not.
