## Functionality
- `ubyteArrayOf` is used to create an array of unsigned bytes in Kotlin.

## Concept
- In Kotlin, an array of unsigned bytes, or `ubyteArrayOf`, represents a collection of bytes with values ranging from 0 to 255.

## Performance
- No specific performance insights were identified for `ubyteArrayOf`.

## Directive
- No specific directives were identified for `ubyteArrayOf`.

## Pattern
- `ubyteArrayOf` is often used to handle raw binary data where signed byte values are not appropriate or would lead to incorrect data interpretation.

## Environment
- `ubyteArrayOf` is part of the Kotlin Standard Library, which requires Kotlin language support.

## Alternative
- An alternative to using `ubyteArrayOf` for handling unsigned bytes in Kotlin is using `ByteArray` with manual conversion to interpret values as unsigned.
