## Functionality
- `ConnectionEvent` is used to handle events related to connection changes, such as connection creation, disconnection, or reconnection.

## Concept
- A `ConnectionEvent` represents an event object that signifies changes in a connection state within a network or database context.

## Performance
- No specific performance-related knowledge is available for `ConnectionEvent`.

## Directive
- Implement handlers for `ConnectionEvent` to ensure that applications can respond appropriately to connection changes.
- Handlers can be used for tasks such as cleaning up resources after a disconnection or reinitializing state after a reconnection.

## Pattern
- `ConnectionEvent` is commonly used in network applications or database systems to monitor and respond to changes in connection status, ensuring robust connection management.

## Environment
- `ConnectionEvent` requires an environment where connection state changes are monitored, such as a networked system or a database client application.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to `ConnectionEvent` might include specific network or database library events such as `SocketEvent` or `DatabaseConnectionEvent`, depending on the particular system or library in use.
