## Functionality
- The `synchronized` API is used to claim a lock, either belonging to a given object or, if none is provided, the 'this' object, to ensure exclusive access by one thread at a time.
- `synchronized` allows you to control access to certain code by limiting it to one thread at a time.

## Concept
- In the JVM, every object has a lock which can be used to control access to something.
- The `synchronized` keyword is used to claim a lock, either belonging to a given object or 'this' object.
- Holding a lock prevents other threads from holding the lock but does not prevent anything else.
- Threading and synchronization are complex and require caution to avoid issues like race conditions.
- Classes can ideally be documented regarding their interaction with multithreading, such as being 'immutable', 'thread-safe', 'conditionally thread-safe', 'thread-compatible', or 'thread-hostile'.
- Many Java and Kotlin collection classes are thread-compatible, meaning they require external synchronization to be safely accessed from multiple threads.
- Synchronizing every possible access to shared resources is essential to prevent race conditions and maintain consistency.
- Synchronization allows you to control access to certain resources by restricting it to one thread at a time.
- Each object in Java (and by extension, Kotlin) has an intrinsic lock or monitor that can be used to ensure only one thread can acquire it at a time.
- Using a `synchronized` method or statement with `this` uses the object's lock for controlling access to the code within that method or block.
- Threads can still access non-synchronized code within an object, such as other methods or code outside of a `synchronized` block.
- Using a single lock for multiple synchronized blocks within an object can be limiting, as it unnecessarily serializes tasks that could safely run concurrently.
- Separate lock objects can be used for different tasks to achieve more granular synchronization, allowing concurrent task execution without interference.
- If tasks are interdependent and involve calling each other, using separate locks can lead to deadlocks; in such cases, a shared lock should be used.
- A separate locking object can be shared between different instances of a class or even different classes if their operations could interfere with each other.
- A companion object in Kotlin acts as a singleton or static-like object and could be used as a lock for shared locking purposes.
- A private lock object restricts its use to within the class, preventing other classes from using it as a lock.
- Explicitly creating locking objects encourages the programmer to think carefully about the locking strategy and what is being locked.

## Directive
1. Exercise caution when using `synchronized` as it is a low-level and tricky construct.
2. Consider using higher-level concurrency constructs like work queues, executors, map/reduce, or actors, if they fulfill your needs, for easier management of concurrency.
3. The `synchronized` function in Kotlin is used to claim a lock on a given object or the current object (`this`), preventing other threads from acquiring the same lock until released.
4. Holding a lock only prevents other threads from holding the same lock; it does not prevent other actions by threads.
5. Ensure every possible access to shared mutable state (like a list) is synchronized to prevent race conditions and inconsistent states.
6. Be aware that improper synchronization can lead to issues such as race conditions, inconsistent states, or deadlocks, potentially causing significant application problems like infinite loops or high CPU usage.
7. Relying on a single lock for all synchronized code in an object instance can be limiting and inefficient, as separate blocks that could run concurrently are unnecessarily held up.
8. Using separate lock objects for different synchronized blocks can make synchronization more granular and efficient.
9. Care must be taken to avoid deadlocks when tasks involve calling each other's synchronized code; such tasks should use a shared lock.
10. A separate locking object can be shared between different instances of a class or different classes to prevent interference.
11. Using a private lock object ensures it's used only internally, improving encapsulation and preventing other classes from using it as a lock.
12. The choice of locking on a specific object (e.g., `LOCK` vs. `Companion`) may be influenced by readability, planning for future granular locks, or habits of explicitly creating locking objects for better conceptual clarity.

## Pattern
- The `synchronized` function is used to claim a lock on a given object or the `this` object if none is specified, allowing only one thread to access the block of code at a time.
- To ensure thread safety using the `synchronized` block in Kotlin (and Java), you must synchronize every possible access to the shared resource (e.g., a list) to prevent race conditions and ensure consistent state.
- The `synchronized` block provides a low-level mechanism for synchronization by using locks, and it's recommended to consider higher-level constructions (like work queues, executors, map/reduce, actors, or using immutable objects) when possible for easier multithreading management.
- The lock is automatically released when the synchronized block exits, whether normally or via an exception.
- Nesting `synchronized` blocks can lead to deadlocks if not carefully managed, especially when locking multiple objects.
- Synchronizing on publicly accessible objects (e.g., method parameters or global objects) is discouraged as it can introduce unintentional lock contention.
- Using `synchronized` with lazy-initialized resources is a common pattern to ensure safe, single-time initialization in concurrent environments.

- No environment knowledge was provided.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to `synchronized` include higher-level constructions such as work queues, executors, map/reduce, actors, and using immutable objects.
