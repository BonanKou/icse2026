# MessageDigest API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- `MessageDigest` is used for generating cryptographic hash functions to calculate a hash value (digest) of arbitrary binary data.
- The `digest()` method computes the hash value for the data provided to the `MessageDigest` instance.
- The `update()` method is used to supply data to the `MessageDigest` instance for hashing, which can be done in multiple calls.

## Concept
- `MessageDigest` represents a one-way hash function that is designed to take an input and generate a fixed-size string of bytes, typically a digest that is unique to each unique input.
- A hash function is a mathematical algorithm that maps data of arbitrary size to a bit string of a fixed size (a hash). It is designed to be a one-way function, that is, a function which is infeasible to invert.

## Performance
- The performance of the `MessageDigest` can vary depending on the algorithm used (e.g., SHA-256 is generally slower but more secure compared to MD5).

## Directive
- It is recommended to use stronger hash functions like SHA-256 over weaker ones like MD5 for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities in weaker algorithms.
- Avoid using the same `MessageDigest` instance concurrently across multiple threads as it is not thread-safe.

## Pattern
- `MessageDigest` is commonly used in scenarios where data integrity verification is required, such as checksums for file verification.
- It is often used in security applications and protocols that require unique identifiers, like digital signatures.

## Environment
- `MessageDigest` is available as part of the Java Standard Edition (SE) API and requires no additional libraries beyond the standard Java Development Kit (JDK).

## Alternative
- Alternatives to `MessageDigest` include libraries like Bouncy Castle, which provides a broader range of cryptographic algorithms and is often used when more advanced functionalities are required.
