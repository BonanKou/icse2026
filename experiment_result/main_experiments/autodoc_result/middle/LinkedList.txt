# LinkedList API Documentation

## Functionality
1. LinkedList allows for dynamic modification of its size by adding or removing elements.
2. `LinkedList<T>` allows for creating a linked list of any data type using generics.
3. The `add(T data)` method is used to add an element to the end of the linked list.
4. The `size()` method returns the number of elements in the linked list.
5. The `get(int pos)` method retrieves the element at a specified position in the linked list.
6. The `set(int pos, T data)` method updates the element at a specified position in the linked list.
7. The `delete()` method removes the last element from the linked list.
8. LinkedList's `.add(idx, newItem)` method is O(n) because it has to iterate through elements to reach the correct position for insertion.
9. LinkedList has guaranteed O(1) performance for additions at the beginning of the list.
10. Using `.listIterator()` or `.iterator().remove()` can achieve O(1) performance in LinkedList for operations where ArrayList would be O(n).
11. With a ListIterator, once the correct position is reached, each `.add` operation is O(1).

## Concept
1. `LinkedList` is a doubly linked list in Java, which means each element (node) in the list has a reference to both the previous and the next element.
2. `LinkedList` implements both `List` and `Queue` interfaces.
3. Nodes `first` and `last` being declared as `static` in a `LinkedList` class means that all `LinkedList` instances share the same first and last nodes.
4. `LinkedList` nodes consist of three fields: the value, a reference to the previous node, and a reference to the next node.
5. The `LinkedList` structure itself maintains a reference to the start and end nodes, which are `null` when the list is empty.
6. Tracker objects in `LinkedList` can lead to cache misses, as they may not be stored contiguously in memory.
7. Modern CPUs have an on-die cache that is more efficient for contiguous memory operations, which benefits `ArrayList` operations when the list fits within a cache page.
8. Java does not support mixins or combi-types that could combine types for contiguous memory storage, unlike some other languages.
9. JavaScript lacks many built-in data structures, but its objects allow for flexible additions, like introducing `next` and `prev` pointers for a linked list.
10. `LinkedList`'s performance is often not significantly better than `ArrayList`, even when big-O notation might suggest it should be.
11. Random access in `LinkedList` is slower (`O(n)`) compared to `ArrayList` (`O(1)`), making it inefficient for index-based operations.
12. `LinkedList` is better suited for scenarios with frequent insertions and deletions at the beginning or middle of the list.
13. Iterating over a `LinkedList` using a `ListIterator` is generally preferred over repeatedly calling `get(index)` due to performance.
14. `LinkedList` consumes more memory than `ArrayList` due to the extra node pointers required for each element.
15. Converting a `LinkedList` to an array using `toArray()` can improve access speed if random access is frequently needed afterward.

## Performance
1. `LinkedList`'s `.add(idx, newItem)` method has O(n) time complexity due to the necessity of iterating through elements to reach the desired index.
2. `LinkedList`'s cache performance is poor due to non-contiguous memory allocation, causing cache misses during traversal.
3. `LinkedList`'s extra memory overhead due to tracker objects increases memory usage compared to other data structures like `ArrayList`.
4. `LinkedList` performs well for add operations at the start of the list, which are O(1).
5. `ArrayList` benefits from contiguous memory allocation, making operations effectively instantaneous when the entire list fits into a single cache page.
6. Using `ListIterator` to achieve O(1) insertions in `LinkedList` is possible after reaching the desired position.
7. `ArrayDeque` offers better performance characteristics for insertions and removals both at the start and end of the list.
8. Finding scenarios where `LinkedList` outperforms `ArrayList` is rare, even when theoretical big-O notation may suggest otherwise.
9. `LinkedList` is not thread-safe, so concurrent modifications require external synchronization or using thread-safe variants like `CopyOnWriteArrayList` (though it is not a true linked list).
10. Insertion and deletion in the middle of a `LinkedList` are theoretically efficient but still require traversal to reach the insertion point.
11. When frequent random access is needed, `LinkedList` is a poor choice compared to `ArrayList`, due to O(n) access time.
12. `LinkedList` is suitable in use cases like implementing queues or deques where access is mostly sequential and at the ends.
13. Garbage collection in `LinkedList` may take longer due to each node being an individually allocated object.

## Directive
1. When modifying a LinkedList while looping over it, avoid using a simple index-based loop as the list size changes with element removal, leading to skipped elements.
2. Instead of looping from the start, loop over the LinkedList from the end to avoid skipping elements, though this has a time complexity of O(nÂ²).
3. A better approach is to use a ListIterator to remove elements, which provides a time complexity of O(n).
4. When using LinkedList's `.add(idx, newItem)` method, remember that it is O(n) because it must iterate through elements to reach the desired index.
5. To achieve O(1) performance when modifying LinkedList, utilize `.listIterator()`, or `.iterator().remove()` methods; ListIterator can be used to reach the desired position, and subsequent additions are O(1).
6. LinkedList performs well with operations at the beginning, offering O(1) for additions.
7. LinkedList's non-contiguous memory allocation may result in inefficient cache usage, leading to poor actual performance despite theoretical advantages.
8. When using the LinkedList API, instantiate a LinkedList object directly for functionality from both List and Queue interfaces.

## Pattern
1. LinkedList is commonly perceived to have better insertion and deletion time for cases with large data sets, but this is generally not true except in very rare circumstances.
2. LinkedList is used when you need a data structure that implements both the List and Queue interfaces, allowing access to methods from both interfaces such as `poll`.
3. The post illustrates the use of generics with the LinkedList API in Java to handle multiple data types without creating separate classes for each type.

## Environment

## Alternative
1. Alternatives to LinkedList include ArrayList, ArrayDeque, TreeMap, HashMap, databases, skiplists, primitive lists, and enumsets.
