# MouseListener API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- No specific functionality knowledge snippets were provided for MouseListener.

## Concept
- The `MouseInputListener` interface combines the functionalities of both `MouseListener` and `MouseMotionListener`.
- The Java Tutorials provide guides on implementing `MouseListener` and `MouseMotionListener` for handling mouse events in a Swing application.
- `MouseInputListener` is commonly used with components like `JPanel` or `JComponent` to track both clicks and movement within a single interface.
- Implementing `MouseInputListener` helps reduce boilerplate code by avoiding the need to register separate listeners for mouse actions and motion events.

## Performance
- No specific performance knowledge snippets were provided for MouseListener.

## Directive
- To handle mouse button events within a `MouseListener`, it's recommended to use the `SwingUtilities` class.

## Pattern
- Example usage of `SwingUtilities` within a `mouseDragged` method to print which mouse button is pressed and the coordinates of the mouse event.

## Environment
- No specific environment knowledge snippets were provided for MouseListener.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to `MouseListener` include the `MouseInputListener` interface, which implements both `MouseListener` and `MouseMotionListener`.
- Methods like `isLeftMouseButton`, `isMiddleMouseButton`, and `isRightMouseButton` can help determine which mouse button was pressed during mouse events.
- `SwingUtilities` provides a convenient way to handle different mouse button events without manually checking event button codes.
