# TensorSpec API Document

## Functionality
- `tf.TensorSpec` is used to define the properties of a tensor, including its shape and dtype.

## Concept
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `shape` argument to specify the shape of the tensor.
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `dtype` argument to specify the data type of the tensor.
- An example of using `tf.TensorSpec` is `tf.TensorSpec(dtype=tf.int64, shape=[2])`, which defines a tensor with two values of data type `tf.int64`.
