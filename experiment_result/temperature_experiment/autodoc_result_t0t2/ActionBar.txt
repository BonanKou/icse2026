# ActionBar API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- ActionBar makes important actions accessible in a predictable way, such as Search.
- ActionBar supports consistent navigation and view switching within apps.
- ActionBar reduces clutter by providing an action overflow for rarely used actions.
- ActionBar provides a dedicated space for giving your app an identity.
- ActionBar is used to set the title of the action bar using the `setTitle` method.
- The ActionBar provides a dedicated space for giving your app an identity and indicating the user's location in the app. It offers access to important actions in a predictable way, such as search, and supports navigation and view switching (with tabs or drop-down lists).

## Concept
- ActionBar is the element present at the top of the activity screen.
- ActionBar is a salient feature of a mobile application that has a consistent presence over all its activities.
- The app bar, also known as the action bar, is a crucial design element in Android app activities.
- The app bar provides a visual structure and interactive elements that are familiar to users.
- Using the app bar makes an app consistent with other Android apps, enhancing user experience.
- Familiarity and consistency in design are important for user comfort and ease of use.
- Default UI elements, like the app bar, may work better with the operating system in terms of performance (e.g., cache, CPU).
- Toolbar is a View included in a layout like any other View.
- As a regular View, the Toolbar is easier to position, animate, and control.
- Multiple distinct Toolbar elements can be defined within a single activity.

## Performance
- Default UI elements, like the app bar, might work better with the operating system in terms of performance (e.g., cache, CPU).

## Directive
- When design is synchronized with the ActionBar, it is better to use it, but for a flexible design, a custom Toolbar should be used.
- Consider replacing ActionBar with Toolbar if you want a flexible header that allows for adding background images, animations, etc. If such flexibility is not needed, continue using ActionBar.
- When setting titles, avoid setting both the ActionBar title and the Toolbar title simultaneously, as this can cause conflicts.
- To set the title of an ActionBar, use `getSupportActionBar()` to get the ActionBar instance and then call `setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE")` on it.
- To set the title of a custom Toolbar, find the Toolbar view using `findViewById(R.id.toolbar)` and then call `setTitle("TOOLBAR TITLE")` on it.
- Users generally prefer familiar designs as they do not have to relearn navigation, which enhances usability.

## Pattern
- ActionBar is commonly used to set a consistent title across the top of an activity screen using `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE");`.
- ActionBar provides a consistent navigation bar across Android applications and is a salient feature with a consistent presence over all activities.
- The ActionBar is commonly used to provide a consistent navigation bar across Android applications, offering a familiar user interface that enhances user experience by maintaining consistency with other Android apps. It serves as a dedicated space for app identity, user location indication, access to important actions like search, and supports navigation and view switching through tabs or drop-down lists.
- Developers may choose ActionBar when the design is in sync with it, but opt for a custom Toolbar for more flexible design needs.
- Replacing ActionBar with Toolbar is recommended if a flexible header is needed, allowing for features like adding background images and animations.
