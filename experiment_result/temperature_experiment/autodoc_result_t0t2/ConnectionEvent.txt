# ConnectionEvent API Knowledge

## Functionality
- ConnectionEvent is used to notify listeners about changes in the state of a connection.

## Concept
- ConnectionEvent is part of an event-driven architecture where events are used to communicate changes in state or other significant occurrences.

## Performance
- No specific performance-related information is available for ConnectionEvent.

## Directive
- When using ConnectionEvent, ensure that listeners are properly registered to handle the events.
- Avoid performing long-running operations within the event handler to prevent blocking the event dispatch thread.

## Pattern
- ConnectionEvent is commonly used in applications that require monitoring of network connections, such as chat applications or online multiplayer games.

## Environment
- ConnectionEvent requires an environment that supports event-driven programming, typically found in frameworks or libraries that provide event handling capabilities.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to ConnectionEvent may include custom event handling mechanisms or other event-driven libraries that provide similar functionality for monitoring connection states.
