# ActionBar API Knowledge Document

## Functionality
- ActionBar makes important actions accessible in a predictable way, such as Search.
- ActionBar supports consistent navigation and view switching within apps.
- ActionBar reduces clutter by providing an action overflow for rarely used actions.
- ActionBar provides a dedicated space for giving your app an identity.
- ActionBar is used to set the title of the navigation bar across Android applications using the `setTitle` method.

## Concept
- ActionBar is the element present at the top of the activity screen.
- ActionBar is a salient feature of a mobile application that has a consistent presence over all its activities.
- The app bar, also known as the action bar, is a crucial design element in Android apps because it provides a visual structure and interactive elements familiar to users.
- Using the app bar helps make an app consistent with other Android apps, enhancing user understanding and experience.
- Users generally prefer familiar designs because they don't have to adapt to new interfaces, which can slow down their interaction with the app.
- Default UI elements may perform better with the operating system, potentially impacting performance aspects like cache and CPU usage.
- Toolbar is a View included in a layout like any other View and is easier to position, animate, and control compared to ActionBar.
- Multiple distinct Toolbar elements can be defined within a single activity.

## Performance
- Default UI elements, such as the ActionBar, might work better with the operating system in terms of performance, including aspects like cache and CPU usage.
- The ActionBar is optimized for the operating system's UI framework, leading to better responsiveness and resource management.
- Using system-provided UI elements ensures consistency in behavior and design, which can improve user experience and reduce bugs related to custom UI implementations.
- Custom UI components can sometimes introduce overhead in terms of memory and processing, as they may not be as optimized as default components.
- System-provided UI elements like the ActionBar are often designed to handle different screen sizes and orientations seamlessly, reducing the need for additional customization.
- Using the ActionBar allows for better integration with system-level features, such as the back button or navigation gestures, which can improve usability.
- Default UI components are typically better supported across different Android versions, ensuring a more consistent experience for users.

## Directive
- When the design is synchronized with the ActionBar, it is better to use it; otherwise, for a flexible design, use a custom Toolbar.
- Consider replacing ActionBar with Toolbar if you want a flexible header that allows for customization like adding background images and animations.
- When setting titles, do not set both the ActionBar title and the toolbar title at the same time, as it may not work correctly.
- To set the title of the ActionBar, use `getSupportActionBar()` and `actionBar.setTitle("ACTIONBAR TITLE")`.
- To set the title of a custom toolbar, find the toolbar by its ID and use `toolbar.setTitle("TOOLBAR TITLE")`.
- Custom action bars can provide robust and diverse functionality, but may impact UI/UX negatively if they deviate from familiar designs.

## Pattern
- Developers may choose ActionBar if their design is in sync with it, but opt for a custom Toolbar if a more flexible design is needed, such as adding background images or animations.
- Setting the title of an ActionBar in Android can be done using the `setTitle` method on an ActionBar object obtained via `getSupportActionBar()`.
- The ActionBar is commonly used to provide a consistent navigation bar across Android applications, offering a familiar user interface with key functions such as app identity, access to important actions, and support for navigation and view switching.
