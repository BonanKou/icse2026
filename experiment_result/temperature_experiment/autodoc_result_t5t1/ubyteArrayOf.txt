## Functionality
- `ubyteArrayOf` is used to create a `UByteArray` in Kotlin, which is an array of unsigned bytes.
- `ubyteArrayOf` allows you to initialize a `UByteArray` with a list of unsigned byte values.

## Concept
- A `UByte` in Kotlin represents an unsigned 8-bit integer, which can hold values from 0 to 255.
- `UByteArray` is a type in Kotlin that represents an array of `UByte` values.

## Performance
- Creating a `UByteArray` using `ubyteArrayOf` is efficient for initializing small arrays with known values.
- `ubyteArrayOf` is optimized for performance, handling unsigned bytes without the overhead of additional conversions.

## Directive
- When using `ubyteArrayOf`, ensure that all values provided are within the range of 0 to 255 to avoid runtime errors.
- Prefer `ubyteArrayOf` for initializing `UByteArray` when the values are known at compile time for better readability and performance.

## Pattern
- `ubyteArrayOf` is commonly used in scenarios where a buffer of unsigned byte data needs to be initialized, such as in networking or file I/O operations.

## Environment
- `ubyteArrayOf` requires Kotlin 1.3 or later, as unsigned types were introduced in this version.
- It can be used in any Kotlin environment that supports unsigned types, including JVM, Native, and JavaScript targets.

## Alternative
- An alternative to `ubyteArrayOf` is using `UByteArray(size) { index -> value }` for more complex initialization logic.
- For signed byte arrays, the standard `byteArrayOf` can be used instead of `ubyteArrayOf`.
