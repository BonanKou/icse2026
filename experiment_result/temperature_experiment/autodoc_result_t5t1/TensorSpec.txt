# TensorSpec API Documentation

## Functionality
- `tf.TensorSpec` is used to describe the properties of a tensor, including its shape and data type (`dtype`).

## Concept
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `shape` argument that specifies the shape of the tensor.
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `dtype` argument that specifies the data type of the tensor.
- When a `tf.TensorSpec` is defined with `shape=[2]` and `dtype=tf.int64`, it describes a tensor with two values, each of type `tf.int64`.
