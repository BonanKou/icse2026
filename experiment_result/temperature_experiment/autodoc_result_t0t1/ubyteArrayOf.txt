## Functionality
- `ubyteArrayOf` is used to create an array of unsigned bytes in Kotlin.

## Concept
- An unsigned byte in Kotlin is a data type that can hold values from 0 to 255, unlike a signed byte which ranges from -128 to 127.

## Performance
- There are no specific performance details provided for `ubyteArrayOf`.

## Directive
- When using `ubyteArrayOf`, ensure that the values provided are within the range of 0 to 255 to avoid compilation errors.

## Pattern
- `ubyteArrayOf` is commonly used when you need to handle binary data or perform operations that require unsigned byte arrays, such as working with file I/O or network protocols.

## Environment
- `ubyteArrayOf` requires Kotlin version 1.3 or higher, as unsigned types were introduced in this version.

## Alternative
- An alternative to `ubyteArrayOf` is using `ByteArray` with manual handling of unsigned values, though this requires additional logic to manage the unsigned nature of the data.
