# TensorSpec API Document

## Functionality
- `tf.TensorSpec` is used to define the shape and dtype of a TensorFlow tensor.
- `tf.TensorSpec` is used to describe the properties of a tensor, including its shape and data type.

## Concept
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `shape` argument that defines the shape of the tensor.
- `tf.TensorSpec` has a `dtype` argument that specifies the data type of the tensor.
- A `TensorSpec` with `shape=[2]` and `dtype=tf.int64` describes a tensor with two values of data type `tf.int64`.
