# ConnectionEvent API Knowledge

## Functionality
- ConnectionEvent is used to notify listeners about changes in the state of a connection, such as when a connection is established or closed.

## Concept
- ConnectionEvent is part of an event-driven architecture where events are used to communicate changes in state or other significant occurrences within a system.

## Performance
- There are no specific performance details provided for ConnectionEvent.

## Directive
- When implementing ConnectionEvent, ensure that all listeners are properly registered to receive notifications about connection state changes.
- Avoid blocking operations within the event handler for ConnectionEvent to prevent delays in processing other events.

## Pattern
- ConnectionEvent is commonly used in network applications to manage and respond to changes in connection status, such as reconnecting when a connection is lost.

## Environment
- ConnectionEvent requires an event-driven framework or library that supports event handling and listener registration.

## Alternative
- Alternatives to ConnectionEvent may include custom event handling mechanisms or other event-driven libraries that provide similar functionality for managing connection state changes.
