 Sure, here's a comprehensive list of knowledge snippets regarding CheckpointManager, covering seven types of knowledge:

Functionality:

1. The CheckpointManager API allows saving the model.history.history whenever a checkpoint is saved, using `joblib.dump()`.
2. The CheckpointManager API can check if the checkpoint exists and, if it does, load it when starting the program.
3. The CheckpointManager API can assign the proper value of model.history.history and remove the old value when starting training.
4. The CheckpointManager API has an 'on_train_begin' event, which is triggered at the start of training, and it can reassign the value of model.history.history from the stored history and delete the stored history.

Concept:

1. CheckpointManager is used to manage model checkpoints during training, and it allows for saving, restoring, and monitoring of model states. Multiple checkpoints can be saved over time.
2. Model progress can be tracked using the model._current_epoch variable, which stores the last completed epoch.
3. During model initialization or when loading checkpoint, `joblib.dump()` and `joblib.load()` functions are used to save and load pickle files, respectively, which include model.history.history and model._history.
4. There's a call-back function `on_train_begin()` that overwrites the latest value of model.history.history with the loaded value from a checkpoint when training starts, and deletes the old value from `model._history`.

Performance:

1. The CheckpointManager API has an 'on_train_begin' event, which is triggered at the start of training, and it can reassign the value of model.history.history from the stored history and delete the stored history.
2. The CheckpointManager API can save the final model after the training has completed, regardless of the result.

Directive:

1. The CheckpointManager API provides guidelines on the proper use of the API, including best practices to follow and actions to avoid.
2. The CheckpointManager API suggests other APIs offering similar functionality, which can be considered as replacements or complementary options.

Environment:

1. The CheckpointManager API requires TensorFlow installed and supports both
