 Sure, I can help you with that! Here's a comprehensive and accurate list of knowledge snippets regarding Attr, covering seven types of knowledge as described in your instruction:

Functionality:

* Attr allows defining custom attributes for views and themes.
* Attr enables the creation of custom views with custom attributes that can be defined in an `attrs.xml` file and used in the XML file of the custom view.
* Attr provides a way to obtain the styles from the currently used context, using the `obtainStyledAttributes` method.
* Attr allows retrieving the value of a custom attribute using the `getColor` method, providing the attribute's resource ID and a default value in case the attribute is not set in the XML file.

Concept:

* Attr is essentially a high-dimensional array.

Performance:

* Attr has overhead when used on large tensors.

Directive:

* When using Attr, ensure indices are within the shape of the input tensor.

Environment:

* Attr requires TensorFlow installed and supports both CPU and GPU execution.

Alternative:

* Alternatives to Attr include tf.scatter_nd and tf.index_select.

The Attr API, as demonstrated in the provided post, is not directly utilized. However, the post uses the Android Attributes system to handle custom attributes passed to the `StrokedTextView` View from XML.

The following are the actions or operations performed with the attributes:

1. The custom View reads and extracts attribute values from the passed AttributeSet object:
	* textColor: `a.getColor(R.styleable.StrokedTextAttrs_textColor, textColor);`
	* textSize: `a.getDimensionPixelSize(R.styleable.StickerTextAttrs_textSize, 0);`
	* text: `a.getString(R.styleable.StrokedTextAttrs_text);`
2. The `onMeasure()` method adjusts the view dimensions based on the specified attribute values and constraints provided in the MeasureSpec objects:
	* width: `width = Math.min(desiredWidth, widthSize);`
	* height: `height = Math.min(desiredHeight,
