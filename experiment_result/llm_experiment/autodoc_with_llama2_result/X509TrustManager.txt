 API Document: X509TrustManager

Functionality:

1. Manages X.509 certificate trust validation in Java.
2. Validates the server's certificate by comparing it with a trusted CA certificate.
3. Can add certificates to a trusted source (CommonTrustedCertificateSource) to resolve issues with incomplete CA chains.
4. Can be used to establish a secure communication with a web server by managing X.509 certificate trust validation.
5. Contains the trust anchors for a secure connection, i.e., the certificates that are trusted.
6. Performs checks to build a valid trust path to a trust anchor when presented with a certificate from the server.
7. Requires the trust store to be available and unaltered to maintain secure communication and connection availability.
8. Is usually protected by Transport Layer Security (TLS) for securing the connection from attacks.
9. Can be used to validate X.509 certificates during an HTTPs connection.
10. Controls the acceptance of X.509 certificates for secure communication between a party (client or server) in a Java environment.

Concept:

1. Tensor is essentially a high-dimensional array.

Performance:

1. Has overhead when used on large tensors.

Directive:

1. Ensure indices are within the shape of the input tensor.

Pattern:

1. Commonly used in embedding lookup operations.

Environment:

1. Requires TensorFlow installed and supports both CPU and GPU execution.

Alternative:

1. Alternatives to tf.gather include tf.scatter_nd and tf.index_select.

Inferred Knowledge:

1. Adding a self-signed certificate to the truststore is a common practice for securing communication between a client (such as a Spring app in this case) and a server.
2. The X509TrustManager interface, used for managing X.509 certificate trust validation, can be employed to add certificates to a truststore.
3. By adding certificates to the truststore, only trusted clients are authorized to make requests, ensuring secure communication.
4. In the context discussed,
