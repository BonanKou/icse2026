 Based on the provided Stack Overflow posts, the following is a comprehensive and accurate list of knowledge snippets regarding URISyntaxException:

1. Using the `URI::toURL` method is recommended over the deprecated `java.net.URL` constructor to avoid URISyntaxException.
2. Violating the RFC 2396 escaping mechanism when constructing URIs could result in URISyntaxException.
3. The `UriBuilder.toTemplate()` method is used to create a URI template with both actual and template parameters.
4. The `UriBuilder` class is used for constructing and handling URIs.
5. URISyntaxException can be triggered when an incorrect syntax is provided for a URI while trying to embed credentials within it.
6. Customized credentials can be embedded in the URI, allowing the API to validate and parse them as needed.
7. URISyntaxException is not directly mentioned in this post, but it discusses the usage and functionality of URIs, base URIs, and namespaces in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework) data and xml parsing.
8. URISyntaxException API is not directly mentioned in this post, but it can be inferred that the post discusses the usage and functionality of URIs, base URIs, and namespaces in the context of RDF (Resource Description Framework) data and xml parsing.
9. URISyntaxException can be triggered when constructing a URI with a incomplete or incorrect syntax.
10. URISyntaxException can be triggered when constructing a URI with a syntax that violates the RFC 2396 escaping mechanism.
11. The `UriBuilder` class is used for constructing and handling URIs, and it has a method `toTemplate()` which is used when dealing with URI templates.
12. The `UriBuilder.toTemplate()` method is used to create a URI template with both actual and template parameters.
13. URISyntaxException can be triggered when an incorrect syntax is provided for a URI while trying to embed credentials within it.
14. Customized credentials can be embedded in the URI, allowing the API to validate and parse them as needed.
15. The `URISyntaxException` API provides ways to construct and validate uniform resource identifiers (URIs).
