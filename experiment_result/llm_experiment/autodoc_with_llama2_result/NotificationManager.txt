 Sure, I can summarize the knowledge snippets regarding NotificationManager into a comprehensive and accurate list. Here is a list of seven types of knowledge regarding NotificationManager:

Functionality:

* NotificationManager API is used to create and display custom notifications in Android applications.
* NotificationManager API allows developers to use NotificationChannels in Android 8.0 (API level 26) and assign notifications to these channels.
* NotificationManager API provides functionality for creating and associating Notification Channels with notifications in Android applications.
* NotificationManager API's `addNotificationReceivedListener` function is used to track when the user clicks on a notification.

Concept:

* NotificationManager API covers foundational ideas and terminologies for understanding and effectively utilizing an API.
* Tensor is essentially a high-dimensional array.
* Notification priority does not affect visibility of notifications on Android TV OS and should not be used.

Performance:

* NotificationManager API has overhead when used on large tensors.

Directive:

* When using NotificationManager, ensure indices are within the shape of the input tensor.
* To show a notification in Android 8.0 and above, a Notification Channel needs to be associated with the notification.
* The creation of a new notification Channel is a prerequisite for showing notifications in Android.

Pattern:

* tf.gather is commonly used in embedding lookup operations.

Environment:

* tf.gather requires TensorFlow installed and supports both CPU and GPU execution.

Alternative:

* Alternatives to tf.gather include tf.scatter_nd and tf.index_select.
