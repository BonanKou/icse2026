Here is the comprehensive and accurate list of knowledge snippets regarding SAXParser, categorized into seven types:

**Functionality**

1. SAXParser processes XML content by triggering event-driven callbacks.
2. SAXParser can abort the parse when a specific event (in this case, the final end tag) is notified.
3. SAXParser can be used to count the number of nested start and end tags.
4. SAXParser can be used to deserialize input streams containing XML content.
5. SAXParser allows for an event-driven approach to XML processing through callbacks in the Simple API for XML (SAX) methodology.
6. SAXParser can be used for parsing XML documents using the Simple API for XML (SAX) methodology.
7. SAXParser employs an event-driven approach to XML content processing, which enables efficient handling of XML data.
8. SAXParser can be used for reading data from Excel files using the Apache POI library.
9. SAXParser's ContentHandler can duplicate each event by sending it to two separate ContentHandlers.
10. SAXParser does not support starting parsing at a specific point in the XML document and stopping at a specific point.

**Concept**

1. SAXParser is used to parse XML documents, following the Simple API for XML (SAX) methodology.
2. SAXParser is an event-driven online algorithm for parsing XML documents.
3. SAXParser works with event-driven callbacks, which allows for efficient processing of XML content.
4. SAXParser is used to parse XML documents that may not fit in RAM entirely.
5. SAXParser is a library used for deserialization of input streams, specifically XML.
6. SAXParser is an API used for parsing XML documents using the Simple API for XML (SAX) methodology.
7. SAXParser operates at a lower level than DOM4J and JDOM, requiring more infrastructure code for results.
8. SAXParser does not inherently detect or handle bugs in the user's code.

**Performance**

1. SAXParser allows for efficient processing of large XML documents by only holding a little portion of the original XML in memory at a time.
2. SAXParser can be considered memory efficient when processing XML documents that fit in RAM.
3. SAXParser might be less efficient than StAX for large XML files that do not fit in RAM.
4. SAXParser is mentioned as an ideal library for XML deserialization, implying it might be efficient for this specific task.

**Directive**

1. When using a SAXParser, it's possible to count the number of nested start and end tags
