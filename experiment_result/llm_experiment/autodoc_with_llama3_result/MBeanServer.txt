Here is the comprehensive and accurate list of knowledge snippets regarding MBeanServer, categorized by the seven types of knowledge:

**Functionality**

1. MBeanServer provides a way to interact with JMX MBeans, and the interaction might involve query operations using ObjectName instances.
2. The MBeanServer API is used for managing and accessing MBeans.
3. MBeanServer can perform the following actions:
	* Registering MBeans
	* Querying MBeans
	* Unregistering MBeans
	* Getting MBean attributes
	* Setting MBean attributes
	* Invoking operations on MBeans
	* Adding/removing listeners
	* Notifying listeners
4. MBeanServer can be used to manage JMX MBeans, as seen by the use of @EnableJpaRepositories and @EnableTransactionManagement annotations.
5. MBeanServer can be used to register JMX MBeans, access and manipulate the state of JMX MBeans, and manage Spring Data JPA-related resources.
6. MBeanServer can be used to define and use a custom transaction manager with injected EntityManagerFactory.
7. MBeanServer can be integrated with Karate through writing custom routines.

**Concept**

1. MBeanServer is an interface for managing and accessing the Java Management Extensions (JMX) MBeans.
2. MBeanServer is accessed and used to run queries with an ObjectName.
3. MBeanServer is a Java Management Extensions (JMX) interface that is used for managing and accessing JMX MBeans.
4. MBeanServer provides access to WebLogic's internal MBeans for management and monitoring purposes.
5. MBeanServer is a crucial underlying concept for the API being discussed in the context of Spring Boot and JPA.
6. MBeanServer is related to Java Management Extensions (JMX) and is managed and accessed through an API for MBeans.
7. MBeanServer is an interface for managing and accessing JMX MBeans in Java.

**Performance**

1. Creating a reference to the MBeanServer and running queries using ObjectName may consume some resources, though specifics about the extent or performance implications are not mentioned.
2. The MBeanServer API, when used as instructed by adding the provided JVM property, does not directly expose performance-related information.
3. The operation `getMemoryConsumption()` may have some performance overhead, especially when dealing with a large number of sessions, as it performs a deep size calculation on all instances.
