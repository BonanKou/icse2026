 Functionality:
1. The `URI::toURL()` method can create a URL from an absolute or relative URL.
2. The `Path` and `URI` classes can be used together to construct a file-based URL.
3. URISyntaxException might be thrown when constructing a URI using `UriBuilder` if the resulting URI does not conform to the expected syntax due to incorrect formatting or query parameter usage.
4. URISyntaxException may be thrown when the provided URI syntax is incorrect or the format of credentials within the URI is not followed according to the URISyntax API rules.
5. The URISyntax API can be used to validate and construct domain names as a part of uniform resource identifiers (URIs) in Java.
6. URISyntaxException is a checked exception that is thrown when a URI is not valid according to the specified syntax rules.

Concept:
1. Namespaces: A mechanism for abbreviating URIs to short strings (prefixes) in RDF data.
2. Base URIs: A generic parser/writer mechanism that allows resolving relative URIs in data.
3. Relative URIs: Strings that are resolved against a defined base URI, resulting in a full URI.
4. URI Templates and Path Style Parameter Expansion: A general-purpose way to describe a range of identifiers that include key-value pairs. In this context, a colon (:) serves as a placeholder for a key, while a semicolon (;) separates the key from the value.

Directive:
1. When constructing a URI using `UriBuilder`, make sure to use the `toTemplate()` method to construct a complete URI template that includes template and actual parameters.
2. When embedding credentials in a URI using `URISyntaxException`, make sure to follow the correct format `"https://{username}:{password}@<base_URI>".`

Pattern:
1. UriBuilder is often used to construct URIs in Java APIs like WebTestClient.

Environment:
1. Necessary conditions for using URISyntaxException in Java:
   - Java 4 or later (URI class introduced in Java 4)
   - Using URI::toURL or Path::toURI to construct URLs instead of deprecated public constructors of java.net.URL.
   - Using NIO.2 features for working with files in modern Java.

Alternative:
1. Alternatives to using URISyntaxException for URI construction and validation in Java include the use of `UriTemplate`.
2. In other programming languages like Python, the `urlparse` module can be used for URI manipulation.
3. In JavaScript, you can use the `URL` global class for URL manipulation.
